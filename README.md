# titanic_classifier
Titanic survival classifier for 'Data Analytics and Statistical Learning' course. This repository includes improvements upon the original project - such as the implementation of Deep Neural Networks using pytorch.

The performance will be measured by a late submission to the [Tabular Playground Series - Apr 2021 Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-apr-2021/data)
